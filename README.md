In this repo,I will using PERN stack (postgres,Express,React,Nodejs), 
The Main theme is to:
1.Retrieving all the records
2.Creating pagination,only 20 records per page
when user clicks on next,then next records should be shown
3.Retrieving only records which the user asked in the search box
4.sorting the data based on the option selected by the user
whether it is date or time
